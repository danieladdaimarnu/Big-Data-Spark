    "# Coursework Part 1: Detecting Spam with Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the tasks for IN432 Big Data coursework 2020, part 1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This coursework is about classification of e-mail messages as spam or non-spam in Spark. We will go through the whole process from loading and preprocessing to training and testing classifiers in a distributed way in Spark. We wil use the techniques shown in the lextures and labs. A few additional elements will be introduced here, such as the Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK) and some of the preprocessing and machine learning functions that come with Spark. You are not expected to need anything beyond the material handed out so far and in some cases the Spark documentation, which is linked from this document.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The structure is similar to the lab sheets. A code structure is provided with gaps that you are supposed to fill in. In addition you should run 2 small experiments and comment on the results. The lines where you are supposed to add code or take another action are marked with \">>>\" \n",
    "please leave the \">>>\" in the text, comment out that line, and write your own code in the next line using a copy of that line as a starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerous comments have been added in the text and code cells to guide you through the program. Please read them carefully and ask if anything is unclear. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed the tasks, don't delete the outputs, but download the notebook by clicking on *File* ➡︎ *Download .ipynb* (outputs will be included) and upload it into the coursework submission area on Moodle. This part counts for 50% of the total coursework."

The filtering potentially removes elements from the Values RDD, thus zipping the Values to their respective Keys ensured the removal of the entire (Key-Value) pair. Otherwise, if items or elements of the Values RDD were removed before zipping, we would have been required to manually look for and remove their corresponding keys from the Keys RDD before grouping or zipping them again would be possible.

    "*   Overall, as expected, the training set performs better than the test set, which at best equals the training set. The test set performance provides an estimation of how well the model generalises on unseen data. The difference in the performance of the training and test sets can indicate overfitting or underfitting, which was not established here. For smaller test vector size (such as 3), there is no marked difference in the performance of the training and test sets. This implies that with small test vector size, there are not enough informative attributes to learn to separate the classes. Thus, the models predict exactly the majority class, that is, 'No Spam' (which constitute 83.4% of the labels or target variable).\n",
    "*   The models perform better with increasing test vector size (N). However, past a specific vector size or threshold (notably around 3000), the models' performance is not markedly improved or tend to decrease. This implies that either the document does not have enough tokens or noise and uninformative features are just being added. Thus, the vector would be sparse (that is, containing many 0's).\n",
    "*   The type of pre-processing done in Natural Language Processing is essential as it can help improve the performance of some models. Lemmatisation is grouping words with the same semantic meaning together to strengthen their contribution, whereas removing stop words eliminate noise from the dataset. The application of lemmatisation improved the performance of the logistic regression model from 97.2% to 97.6%.\n",
    "*   All the models used are considered to be linear models; therefore, known to work well on text classification (classes are linearly separable) using bag of words approach. This explains the closeness in training and test set performance for smaller test vector(N). Performance-wise, the Logistic Regression performs best followed by the Naive Bayes and SVM, respectively.\n",
    "*   Logistic Regression is a discriminative model, while Naive Bayes is a generative model. Practically, generative models provide better performance when the dataset is small. In this situation, the size of the dataset is enough for the Logistic Regression to outperform the Naive Bayes. The linear SVM implemented was expected to rival the Logistic Regression, but it failed to do so. The SVM was always predicting 'No Spam'(0), which constitute 83.4% of the dataset, which was why the accuracy of the SVM was always 83.4%. This could be due to failure to converge or the use of stochastic gradient descent, which is an approximation of gradient descent which trades performance for speed. The SVM could benefit from tuning its learning rate and misclassification cost, but the actual problem starts with not having enough data. On the other hand, the L-BFGS used for the Logistic Regression usually result in a better convergence.\n",
    "*   Finally, modeling of spam filtering is affected by class imbalance problems of data. And in this case, the document has less than 20% labelled 'Spam'. Here, accuracy may not be the best performance metric to use because it may favour algorithms that blindly predict majority class most of the time. Naive Bayes is very susceptible to this as class priors are by default usually inferred from the data, which may force predictions to favour the majority class. This can be overcome by adjusting class priors properly or adequately.\n",
